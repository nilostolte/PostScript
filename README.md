# PostScript
Contains PostScript code that can be used with any PostScript interpreter or converter (ex. Acrobat). I made a choice of using 
Ghostview  directly, because one can use some Ghostscript features using shortcuts in Windows.Ghostscript is a stable software
that will continue to be used as time passes by. 

## Examples

This directory contains code that are examples to use PostScript as a graphics script language. For example, details to convert Postscript to Java is given.
