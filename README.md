# PostScript
Contains PostScript code that can be used with any PostScript interpreter or converter (ex. Acrobat). I made a choice of using 
Ghostview  directly, because one can use some Ghostscript features using shortcuts in Windows.Ghostscript is a stable software
that will continue to be used as time passes by. 

## Examples

## 3D Visualization Software

This [directory](https://github.com/nilostolte/Vector-Art/blob/main/Diamonds%20are%20Forever/README.md#diamonds-are-forever) contains an example generated with the 3D visualization software I have developped in PostScript.
