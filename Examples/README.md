# Examples

Several examples of use of PostScript language are shown here. Some uses are quite unexpected and very useful.

## Conversion To Java

The examples here concentrate in converting Postscript vector graphics into Java:

## Egg

Egg as one of the most traditional food products has been attracting mathematicians’, engineers’ and biologists’
attention from analytical point of view since long ago. As a main operand in oomorphology, the shape of a bird’s
egg has, to date, escaped a universally applicable mathematical formulation. Analysis of all egg shapes can be
laid in four geometric figures: sphere, ellipsoid, ovoid, and pyriform (conical or pear-shaped). The first three have
a clear mathematical definition according to [Fritz Hügelschäffer](https://github.com/nilostolte/PostScript/blob/main/Examples/Egg/Egg%20shape.pdf).

[This](https://github.com/nilostolte/PostScript/blob/main/Examples/Egg/egg.ps) is the PostScript code implementing
the shape. Please check [Egg and Math: Introducing a Universal Formula for Egg Shape](https://github.com/nilostolte/PostScript/blob/main/Examples/Egg/Egg%20shape.pdf) article for more details on the
parameters and for a more complete formula for pyriform egg shapes.
